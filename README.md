# cortical_stack
A working representation of the cortical layers. 

The purpose is a general representation of a cortical stack, from the basal dendrites of a pyramidal neuron to the layers themselves.

In terms of the overall function of the layers, the logic mirrors the human brain to a large extent. The top 3 layers, those being the molecular, external granular, and external pyramidal, activate together (resulting in a partially activated stack). At this point, an action is "prepared". Then, as in the human brain, the bottom 2 layers (internal pyramidal, fusiform) execute the action. In a biological sense, this means communication with the thalamus. For the purposes of this abstraction, the command set is carried out. Layer IV, the internal granular, communicates across the stack, sending information everywhere.
